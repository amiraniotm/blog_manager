## About

This is a simple blog manager created in Laravel. I made it as a way to learn basic Laravel back in the day!

It allows you to create, view, edit and erase posts from a mockup blog. It includes authentication with email address via Laravel builtin authentication system.

I deployed it using Heroku but this is not active any longer, please check more updated projects ; )
